# Physical Property Data Sets

Within these directories are the scripts used to curate the experimental physical property
data sets that the vdW force field parameters were trained (`optimizations/`) and tested (`benchmarks/`) 
against.

All data sets were curated using the utilities provided by the `openff-evaluator` package and stored
for easy access in both `nonbonded` data set objects and pandas csv files.

Instructions for curating the sets can be found in each of the sub-directories.
